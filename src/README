- This is programming project for Cloud computing class fall 2016.
-To run the program, go to Simulation.java and run because it has the main method. All other files are classes that are used in the Simulation.java file.
- More information regarding the algorithm and the details of the project are in the report explained.
- Keep in mind that this program requires an input file called test.txt, this input file contains all the available times for all of the cars (7680).
The path of this file is written in Simulation.java line 536. You will have to change the path depending on where the file would be on your machine.
- Keep in mind also that the output of this program simply creates a textfile and displays all the important information in this file, the path of the required
output file would be in Simulation.java line 641.
